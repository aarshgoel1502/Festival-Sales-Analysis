# Festival-Sales-Analysis
This project will perform data analysis techniques to carry out useful conclusions which can be used to carry out data-driven decision making for maximising the profit of a company.

The conclusion will be carried out out based on exploratory data analysis which will directly impact the stakeholders.

OUTPUT :

Married women of age group 26-35 who lives in UP , Maharashtra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.

Therefore,

The company must target this segment in their next marketing campaign to maximize their profits.

The company should also focus slightly more on Footwear & Shoes segment as it shows a great potential market.

The company should also perform surveys in states where the sales are not optimum such as Kerala , Haryana and Gujarat
